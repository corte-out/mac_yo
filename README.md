I found the popular clients to be just not as much vanilla orientated as i wished them to be so, so basically decided to create my own one with features that i both missed from other games/found in other clients. I added more and more features over the time though.
This list is most likely imcomplete (or maybe not, its really not that much and I like to stay mysterious about it) but ive tried to make every feature as optional as possible.

this client was initially based on p1xbraten but got more and more features over the time. Please refer to the credits if you are interested in what work was involved here.
Note that the initial (unpublished) version has way more features included that sadly, due to time and code reasons, couldnt get updated


Why would I use this client? - or rather, why do I use this client instead of other clients
- weaponstats, included stats command, duelstats, mode/sessionlen stats, flagruntimer for hud and consolemessages
- customisable trails (1 color or multiple colors), lightingtrails, renameprotection, spec movement/tele while paused
- highly customisable scoreboard, fragmessages/eventmessages, server search feature
- clientsided demos, demo travers possibility
- improved spec experience, autofollow feature, spec-only playerdisplay (with flag, quad and respawn timer)
- consearch, chatonly logfile, savehistory, unique logfiles
and more... (check cmd_changelog.txt for all features)

other projects by myself (unpublished aswell):
https://github.com/trasherrrr/fb-global - flowerbraten (older version) with global enemy and team colors 
https://github.com/trasherrrr/fb-global-assets - global color assets

what are global colors?
the current team colors are red and blue
this client allows you to dynamically change between other colors
